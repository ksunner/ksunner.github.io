# Project 5 Website

This directory contains the static website for Project 5.

## Deployment

To deploy this website to GitHub Pages:

1.  Push this repository to GitHub.
2.  Go to the repository **Settings** > **Pages**.
3.  Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**.
4.  Select your main branch and ensure the folder is set to `/website` (if your repository root is the parent of this folder) or `/` (if you pushed the contents of this folder to the root of a `gh-pages` branch).
    *   *Note: GitHub Pages defaults to looking in `/` or `/docs`. If you keep this in `/website`, you might need to configure the deployment source or use a GitHub Action.*
    *   **Easiest method:** 
        1. Go to your repo settings.
        2. Enable GitHub Pages.
        3. If you can't select `/website` as a source, you can move these files to `/docs` or the root directory.
